# foodie9ja-uiux-case-study
UI/UX case study of a marketplace app connecting Nigerians abroad to authentic local restaurants. Designed and prototyped in Figma.

# About Foodie9ja
Foodie9ja is a marketplace mobile app concept designed to help Nigerians living abroad easily discover and order authentic Nigerian meals in their area. I designed the complete product flow from onboarding to checkout, focusing on usability and cultural connection.
The logo, icons, and illustrations were created in Adobe Illustrator, while the UI design, interactive components (such as cart quantity adjustment, rating system, favorites feature, and dark mode toggle), and full prototype were developed in Figma.
This project demonstrates my ability to combine branding, interface design, and interaction design to build a community-focused digital product.
